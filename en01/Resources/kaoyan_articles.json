In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to supervise a
series of experiments at a telephone-parts factory called the Hawthorne Plant near
Chicago. It hoped they would learn how shop-floor lighting 1 workers'

effect," the extremely influential idea that the very 3 of being experimented
upon changed subjects' behavior.
The idea arose because of the 4 behavior of the women in the plant.
According to _5_ of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting
was increased, but also when it was dimmed. It did not _6_ what was done in the
experiment; 7 something was changed, productivity rose. A(n) 8 that

record, no systematic 13 was found that levels of productivity were related to
changes in lighting.
It turns out that the peculiar way of conducting the experiments may have led
to 14 interpretations of what happened. 15 lighting was always changed

with the previous Saturday and 17 to rise for the next couple of days. 18

Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during
the past quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable
decline in the scope and seriousness of their arts coverage.
It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of
forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most bigcity
newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of
criticism published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews.
To read such books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once
deemed suitable for publication in general-circulation dailies.
We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published
in England between the tum of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time
when newsprint was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament
to the publications in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted
that the critics of major papers would write in detail and at length about the events
they covered. Theirs was a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their
learning lightly, like George Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to
know what they were about. These men believed in journalism as a calling, and were
proud to be published in the daily press. "So few authors have brains enough or
literary gift enough to keep their own end up in journalism, " Newman wrote, "that I
am tempted to define 'journalism' as 'a term of contempt applied by writers who are
not read to writers who are '."
Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for
the Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now
known solely as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. During his lifetime, though,
he was also one of England's foremost classical-music critics, and a stylist so widely
admired that his Autobiography (1947) became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967,
the first music critic to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and
his vast body of writings on music is unknown save to specialists.
Is there any chance that Cardus's criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect
seems remote. J oumalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodem
readers have little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he
specialized. Moreover, the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong
retreat.

Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called
business methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-click" online payment
system. Merrill Lynch got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One
inventor patented a technique for lifting a box.
Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on
business-method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first
authorized 10 years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it would use a particular case to
conduct a broad review of business-method patents. In re Bilski, as the case is known,
is "a very big deal," says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of
Law. It "has the potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."
Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it
was the Federal Circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in
the so-called State Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling
mutual-fund assets. That ruling produced an explosion in business-method patent
filings, initially by emerging Internet companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to
specific types of online transactions. Later, more established companies raced to add
such patents to their files, if only as a defensive move against rivals that might beat
them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a court filing that it had been issued more
than 300 business-method patents, despite the fact that it questioned the legal basis for
granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street investment firms armed themselves with
patents for financial products, even as they took positions in court cases opposing the
practice.
The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the
energy market. The Federal Circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case
would be heard by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and
that one issue it wants to evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its State Street
Bank ruling.
The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by
the Supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last
April, for example, the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for
"inventions" that are obvious. The judges on the Federal Circuit are "reacting to the
anti-patent trend at the Supreme Court," says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and
professor at George Washington University Law School.

In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that "social epidemics"
are driven in large part by the actions of a tiny minority of special individuals, often
called influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well connected. The
idea is intuitively compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread.
The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible-sounding but
largely untested theory called the "two-step flow of communication": Information
flows from the media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers
have embraced the two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and
influence the influentials, those select people will do most of the work for them. The
theory also seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks,
brands, or neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that
some small group of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is
before anyone else paid attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the
idea that only certain special people can drive trends.
In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding
that influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed.
In fact, they don't seem to be required at all.
The researchers' argument stems from a simple observation about social
influence: With the exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey - whose outsize
presence is primarily a function of media, not interpersonal, influence - even the most
influential members of a population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet
it is precisely these non-celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow
theory, are supposed to drive social epidemics, by influencing their friends and
colleagues directly. For a social epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected
must then influence his or her own acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs,
and so on; and just how many others pay attention to each of these people has little to
do with the initial influential. If people in the network just two degrees removed from
the initial influential prove resistant, for example, the cascade of change won't
propagate very far or affect many people.
Building on this basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied
the dynamics of social influence by conducting thousands of computer simulations of
populations, manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to
influence others and their tendency to be influenced. They found that the principal
requirement for what is called "global cascades" - the widespread propagation of
influence through networks - is the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a
critical mass of easily influenced people.

[A] analyze the consequences of social epidemics.
[B] discuss influentials' function in spreading ideas.
[C] exemplify people's intuitive response to social epidemics.
[D] describe the essential characteristics of influentials.

Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the
scenes, they have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters.
Their rules, moan the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just
not fair. These rules say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay,
not the price managers and regulators would like them to fetch.
Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be
unknowable, but the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper
functioning of capital markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic
assets at prices that attract buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.
After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial Accounting
Standards Board (F ASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom
to use models to value illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on
long-term assets in their income statements. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried
out against those who "question our motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes
enhance what one lobbying group politely calls "the use of judgment by management."
European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without
overall planning, but the pressure to fold when it completes its reconstruction of rules
later this year is strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the
IASB that it did "not live in a political vacuum" but "in the real world" and that Europe
could yet develop different rules.
It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued
assets. Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect
the temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will
not be known for years. But banks' shares trade below their book value, suggesting that
investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which
will not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed
bargains.
To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with.
America's new plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to
levels which buyers find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even
combative standard-setters. The F ASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up
rules on stock options and pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests.
But by giving in to critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions .

[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules.
[B] collect payments from third parties.
[C] cooperate with the price managers.
[D] reevaluate some of their assets.

[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out:
the consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from
about 32 percent of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is
expected to approach 38 percent by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale
demand from the food service segment by 4 to 5 percent a year across Europe,
compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 percent. Meanwhile, as the
recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They tend to keep a tighter
hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic alternative.
[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are at a standstill,
leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading
retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion
abroad. But almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own
backyard: the wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of
market retailers need.
[CJ Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and
drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible
trends dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather
than the seller, to decide what to buy. At any rate, this change will ultimately be
acclaimed by an ever-growing number of both domestic and international
consumers, regardless of how long the current consumer pattern will take hold.
[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably
apply their gigantic scale, existing infrastructure, and proven skills in the
management of product ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers
that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in
substantial profits thereby. At least, that is how it looks as a whole. Closer
inspection reveals important differences among the biggest national markets,
- 11 -
especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, as well as the
competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers must
understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European
wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched
competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.
[EJ Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been
closely examined - France, Germany, Italy and Spain - are made out of the same
building blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent
morn-and-pop grocery stores which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to
buy straight from producers, and food service operators that cater to consumers
when they don't eat at home. Such food service operators range from snack
machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of these businesses are
known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, restaurants, and cafes. Overall, Europe's
wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace as the
retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.
[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales came to $ 268 billion in France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000 - more than 40 percent
of retail sales. Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in
retail; wholesale demand from the food service sector is growing quickly as more
Europeans eat out more often; and changes in the competitive dynamics of this
fragmented industry are at last making it feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.
[GJ However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some
large food producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those
that master the intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable
gams.

One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic
motives is that most members of the land community have no economic value. Yet
these creatures are members of the biotic community and, if its stability depends on
its integrity, they are entitled to continuance.
When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to
love it, we invent excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of the
century songbirds were supposed to be disappearing. ( 46) Scientists jumped to the
rescue with some distinctly shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if
birds failed to control them. The evidence had to be economic in order to be valid.
It is painful to read these roundabout accounts today. We have no land ethic yet,
(47) but we have at least drawn nearer the point of admitting that birds should
continue as a matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of
economic advantage to us.
A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds.
(48) Time was when biologists somewhat overworked the evidence that these
creatures preserve the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey
only on "worthless" species. Here again, the evidence had to be economic in order to
be valid. It is only in recent years that we hear the more honest argument that
predators are members of the community, and that no special interest has the right to
exterminate them for the sake of benefit, real or fancied, to itself.
Some species of trees have been "read out of the party" by economics-minded
foresters because they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale value to pay as timber
crops. ( 49) In Europe, where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the noncommercial
tree species are recognized as members of the native forest community, to be preserved
as such, within reason. Moreover, some have been found to have a valuable function in
building up soil fertility. The interdependence of the forest and its constituent tree
species, ground flora, and fauna is taken for granted.
To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is
hopelessly lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many
elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to
its healthy functioning. It assumes, falsely, that the economic parts of the biotic clock
will function without the uneconomicparts .

Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools (and behaviors surrounding these tools) add value to your life.\n\nThe movement was popularized by computer scientist Cal Newport, who argues that we should be more intentional about our technology use. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through social media or constantly checking our phones, Newport suggests we should carefully consider which technologies truly serve our values and goals.\n\nDigital minimalists don't necessarily reject all technology. Instead, they use technology in a way that supports their most important activities and relationships. This might mean deleting social media apps, turning off notifications, or setting specific times for checking email.\n\nThe benefits of digital minimalism can be significant. People who practice it often report feeling less anxious, more focused, and more connected to the people and activities that matter most to them. They also tend to have more time for deep work, creative pursuits, and face-to-face relationships.\n\nHowever, digital minimalism isn't for everyone.

While AI can process vast amounts of data quickly and identify patterns that humans might miss, there are growing concerns about bias in AI systems.\n\nAI bias occurs when algorithms produce results that are systematically prejudiced due to erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process. This can happen when training data is not representative of the population the AI will serve, or when historical biases present in the data are perpetuated by the algorithm.\n\nFor example, if an AI system used to screen job applications is trained on data from a company that has historically hired more men than women for certain positions, the AI might learn to favor male candidates, even if gender is not explicitly considered in the algorithm.\n\nThe consequences of AI bias can be serious.

    "content": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The scientific consensus is clear: human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are causing global temperatures to rise at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThe effects of climate change are already visible around the world. We're seeing more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and shifts in precipitation patterns. These changes are having profound impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities.\n\nOne of the most concerning aspects of climate change is the potential for feedback loops that could accelerate warming. For example, as Arctic ice melts, less sunlight is reflected back into space, causing further warming. Similarly, as permafrost thaws, it releases stored carbon dioxide and methane, adding to greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.\n\nAddressing climate change requires urgent action on multiple fronts. This includes transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and developing new technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide. International cooperation is essential, as climate change is a global problem that requires coordinated solutions.\n\nWhile the challenge is enormous, there are reasons for optimism. Renewable energy costs have fallen dramatically in recent years, making clean energy increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Many countries, cities, and companies have committed to ambitious climate targets, and public awareness of the issue continues to grow.",

    "content": "The rise of e-commerce has transformed the retail landscape, changing how consumers shop and how businesses operate. Online shopping offers convenience, variety, and often better prices, leading to rapid growth in the sector.\n\nFor consumers, e-commerce provides the ability to shop 24/7 from anywhere, compare prices easily, and access products that might not be available locally. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, as lockdowns and social distancing measures made online shopping a necessity for many people.\n\nBusinesses have also benefited from e-commerce. Online platforms allow companies to reach customers globally without the need for physical stores in every market. This can significantly reduce overhead costs and enable smaller businesses to compete with larger retailers.\n\nHowever, the growth of e-commerce has also created challenges. Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled to compete, leading to store closures and job losses in some sectors. There are also concerns about the environmental impact of increased packaging and shipping, as well as the market dominance of large e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe future of retail is likely to be omnichannel, combining online and offline experiences. Many retailers are investing in technologies that bridge the gap between digital and physical shopping, such as buy-online-pickup-in-store services and augmented reality tools that allow customers to virtually try products before purchasing.",

    "content": "The concept of emotional intelligence has gained significant attention in recent decades, both in academic research and popular culture. Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage our own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.\n\nResearch suggests that emotional intelligence can be more important than traditional measures of intelligence (IQ) in determining success in life and work. People with high emotional intelligence tend to have better relationships, perform better in leadership roles, and experience greater overall well-being.\n\nEmotional intelligence consists of several key components. Self-awareness involves understanding your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. Self-regulation is the ability to manage your emotions effectively, especially in challenging situations. Empathy is the capacity to understand and share the feelings of others. Social skills involve the ability to communicate effectively and build strong relationships.\n\nThe good news is that unlike IQ, which is largely fixed, emotional intelligence can be developed and improved throughout life. This can be done through practices such as mindfulness meditation, seeking feedback from others, and consciously working to understand different perspectives.\n\nIn the workplace, emotional intelligence is increasingly valued by employers. As automation takes over more routine tasks, the ability to work well with others, understand customer needs, and navigate complex social situations becomes even more important.",

    "content": "Urban farming is gaining popularity as cities around the world look for ways to increase food security, reduce environmental impact, and improve community health. This practice involves growing food in urban environments, from rooftop gardens to vertical farms in abandoned buildings.\n\nThere are several advantages to urban farming. It can provide fresh, locally grown produce to urban residents, reducing the need for long-distance transportation of food. This not only cuts down on carbon emissions but also ensures that food is fresher and more nutritious when it reaches consumers.\n\nUrban farming can also help address food deserts – areas where residents have limited access to affordable, nutritious food. By bringing food production closer to consumers, urban farms can make healthy food more accessible to low-income communities.\n\nAdditionally, urban farming can provide educational opportunities and bring communities together. Many urban farms offer workshops and volunteer opportunities, helping people learn about sustainable agriculture and healthy eating.\n\nHowever, urban farming also faces challenges. Space is often limited and expensive in cities, and urban soil may be contaminated with pollutants. There are also questions about the economic viability of urban farms, as they often require significant upfront investment and may struggle to compete with large-scale agricultural operations on price.\n\nDespite these challenges, urban farming continues to grow, supported by advances in technology such as hydroponic and aeroponic systems that allow crops to be grown without soil.",

    "content": "The sharing economy has emerged as a significant force in the global economy, fundamentally changing how we think about ownership and consumption. From car-sharing services like Uber and Lyft to home-sharing platforms like Airbnb, the sharing economy allows people to monetize underutilized assets.\n\nThe appeal of the sharing economy lies in its efficiency and convenience. Instead of owning a car that sits idle most of the time, people can access transportation when they need it. Similarly, homeowners can earn income from spare rooms, while travelers can find unique accommodations at competitive prices.\n\nThis model has environmental benefits as well. By maximizing the use of existing resources, the sharing economy can reduce the need for new production and decrease waste. For example, car-sharing can reduce the total number of vehicles needed, leading to lower emissions and less congestion.\n\nHowever, the sharing economy also raises important questions about regulation, worker rights, and market concentration. Many sharing economy platforms operate in regulatory gray areas, and there are ongoing debates about whether workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors.\n\nThere are also concerns about the impact on traditional industries and local communities. The rise of short-term rentals, for instance, has been blamed for reducing the availability of long-term housing in some cities, driving up rents for residents.\n\nAs the sharing economy continues to evolve, policymakers and society must work to harness its benefits while addressing its challenges.",
